## Available Scripts

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

then start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). You should see the app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

## Building

To create an optimised version of the app:

```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles the application in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
The app is ready to be deployed!

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
